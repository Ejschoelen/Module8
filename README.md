# Module8
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? Testing. Testing is the key to ensuring everything functions properly and is as free of bugs and vulnerabilities as possible.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program? User needs should be provided to you via documentation of some sort such as test cases or a spec sheet of sorts.
How do I approach designing software? Software design should be approached from a viewpoint of: What does the user require and how can I securely give this to them? Ultimately we have to meet the users needs, but what good is this if the softare or users data is vulnerable to attacks/breaches/bugs?
